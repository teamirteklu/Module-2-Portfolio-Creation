            Hello! My name is Teamir Teklu and I'm an aspiring fullstack developer. I love writing stories, playing video games, and I plan on getting
            a cat soon! Besides all that, I have some coding experience in Java, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I am currently attending Denver University's 
            Fullstack Coding Bootcamp and I hope this will be an interesting start into my career in coding! This is my protfolio and any projects I start 
            will be listed here. Enjoy!
